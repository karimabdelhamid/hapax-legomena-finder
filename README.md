# Hapax Legomena Finder

This repository contains a Hapax Legomena Finder, a command-line tool developed for the CIS*2520 Data Structures course at the University of Guelph. It analyzes textual data to identify unique words, termed 'hapax legomena,' which appear only once within a document.

## Introduction

A hapax legomenon is a term used in the analysis of text for a word that occurs only once within a context: typically a single written work, the works of an author, or the works within a particular genre.

## Program Functionality

This command-line tool reads through one or more text files, counts the occurrence of each word, and lists those that appear only once â€” the hapax legomena.

### Usage

```bash
hapax [<options>] <datafile> [ <datafile> ...]

### Options

- `-d`: Print out all data loaded before printing hapax legomena.
- `-h`: Help menu.
- `-l <N>`: Print hapax legomena of length `<N>`. If not specified, all hapax legomena are printed.

### Sample Output

Executing the program will display the total word count and a list of unique words from the input file(s). For instance:

$ ./hapax smalldata.txt 
Total word count: 10
